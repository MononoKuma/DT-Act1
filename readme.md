## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

This project is a Single Page Website with a Responsive Layout designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness through media queries, and Flexbox & CSS Grid for dynamic element arrangement. The layout ensures content is accessible and visually appealing across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. A navbar allows easy navigation, while cards organize key information. The CSS media queries adjust the layout dynamically, ensuring usability and readability. This approach enhances user experience by making the site intuitive, clean, and functional on all devices.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
